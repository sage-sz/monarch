          ladybugs, earthworms, springtails, other non-target organisms and

            assumption that monarch populations occur at the same time as pollen
            shed, go to the heart of the matter of whether monarch larvae will
            be exposed to lethal concentrations of natural deposits of Bt

            >Criticism of the study also focused on the bioassays. As the
            authors noted in their paper, there were large discrepancies between
            the toxin levels in pollen that they measured and those from
            replicated measurements accepted by the EPA. For example, for Bt 11
            corn their level was over four times higher (0.39 versus
            0.09&emsp;&micro;g&emsp;g<sup>&minus;1</sup>). and for event 176
            corn their toxin levels were less than four times lower than the
            EPA-accepted figures. Furthermore, they detected Bt-toxin
            concentrations of 0.052 &micro;g&emsp;g<sup>&minus;1</sup> pollen,
            half the accepted figure for Bt 11, in pollen collected from the
            &lsquo;non-Bt&rsquo; variety 4494. The authors reported that, due to
            the methods they employed in extracting pollen from corn tassels,
            the resulting pollen samples contained 43% of plant debris. The
            impact of this debris has been shown by Hellmich, Siegfried, Sears,
            Stanley-Horn, Mattila, Spences, Bidne and Lewis (unpublished
            results) to cause significant mortality, and reduce weight gain by
            &gt;80%, of larvae exposed to contaminated versus uncontaminanted
            pollen samples. Such debris is an artifact of the collection method.
            Thus it was not surprising that high doses of this non-Bt variety
            caused the same mortality to larvae as high doses of event Bt 11
            transgenic corn. Furthermore, it was odd that there was 40% survival
            of larvae exposed to event Bt 11 pollen at doses of both 135 and
            1300 grains cm<sup>&minus;2</sup>. These questions about the study,
            along with the fact that event 176, which has a higher concentration
            of Bt in the pollen, constitutes &lt;2% of the corn acreage planted
            in 2000, did not seem to enter the public discussion of this report.

          >The monarch has become the symbol of the anti-GMO movement. In early
          2001, the Environmental Defense Fund sent its fund-raising letter with
          the following opening remarks: "Each year, millions of black and
          orange Monarch butterflies migrate thousands of miles from Mexico to
          Canada . . . but new scientific evidence suggests that the milkweed
          Monarch caterpillars are eating may kill them and unless we act now,
          there could be more unpleasant &rsquo;genetic surprises&rsquo; in the
          near future." Similarly, the January/February issue of the magazine of
          the Sierra Club, <em>Sierra</em>, has a postcard in it addressed to
          the CEO of Kraft Foods asking them to "move to GE-free production". On
          the other side of the card is a collage of Monarch butterflies with
          the words, "Genetically engineered food - even butterflies find it
          hard to swallow".

            >We find these &lsquo;statements&rsquo; irresponsible from a
            scientific viewpoint, and believe they were created, in part, due to
            a rush to publish reports that were incomplete and misleading.
            Further more, we believe that such a focus on the monarch situation
            has caused some scientists to shift their research focus away from
            more pressing and worthy aspects of agricultural research.</span

            insecticides,</span

          including their effects on non-target organisms. Microbial
          insecticides, such as Bt, have been around for decades but are not
          widely used because
          <span style="background-color: #000000"
            >they have not provided the level of control required at a
            reasonable cost. In fact, despite Bt being available for
            &gt;40&emsp;years as a foliar insecticide, it accounts for &lt;2% of
            all insecticides.</span
          >
          It was only when the genes for production of Bt proteins were
          <em>engineered into plants</em> that Bt became a major insecticide. Bt
          plants were grown on 11.5 million ha in 2000 (<a

            Bt plants</span

          of its own, a life much larger than the laboratory study which placed
          it squarely in the center of the controversy. As with any technology,
          there will be questions raised about the potential environmental
          effects of transgenic plants,<span style="background-color: #000000">
            but these concerns should be addressed in a rigorous scientific
            fashion unencumbered by sensationalism. We hope that scientists, the
            media, public policy-makers and the general public will regain their
            rightful roles in the dialogue about agricultural biotechnology, and
            be able to view the forthcoming data on field studies of monarchs
            and Bt corn in a more thoughtful and reserved manner than was
            observed with the previous two reports on monarch butterflies and Bt
            corn.</span
