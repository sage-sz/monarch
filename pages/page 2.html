          containing genes from the bacterium B. thuringiensis) that express
          proteins toxic to some insects, the EPA conducted risk assessments of
          the potential effects of Bt endotoxins on a wide range of organisms
          including birds, aquatic invertebrates, honey bees, ladybugs,
          earthworms, springtails, other non-target organisms and endangered
          species. In 1995, the EPA provided its opinion on the Ciba-Geigy
          application (Event 176) and stated ". . . the Agency can foresee no
          unreasonable adverse effects to humans, non-target organisms, or to

          and non-Bt corn. The potted plants were retrieved and examined for
          pollen deposition, and the leaves were assayed for the presence of Bt
          pollen by placing first-instar larvae on the leaves and allowing them
          to feed. As expected, pollen levels were highest on plants placed

          from N4640 (a Bt hybrid producing Cry1Ab protein) or an unrelated,
          untransformed hybrid onto milkweed leaves and placing 3-day-old
          monarch larvae on the plants.

            consumption of leaves dusted with Bt or untransformed pollen,
            compared with control leaves with no pollen. From these laboratory

          >Criticism of the study also focused on the bioassays. As the authors
          noted in their paper, there were large discrepancies between the toxin
          levels in pollen that they measured and those from replicated
          measurements accepted by the EPA. For example, for Bt 11 corn their
          level was over four times higher (0.39 versus
          0.09&emsp;&micro;g&emsp;g<sup>&minus;1</sup>). and for event 176 corn
          their toxin levels were less than four times lower than the
          EPA-accepted figures. Furthermore, they detected Bt-toxin
          concentrations of 0.052 &micro;g&emsp;g<sup>&minus;1</sup> pollen,
          half the accepted figure for Bt 11, in pollen collected from the
          &lsquo;non-Bt&rsquo; variety 4494. The authors reported that, due to
          the methods they employed in extracting pollen from corn tassels, the
          resulting pollen samples contained 43% of plant debris. The impact of
          this debris has been shown by Hellmich, Siegfried, Sears,
          Stanley-Horn, Mattila, Spences, Bidne and Lewis
          <span style="background-color: #000000">(unpublished results)</span>
          to cause significant mortality, and reduce weight gain by &gt;80%, of
          larvae exposed to contaminated versus uncontaminanted pollen samples.
          Such debris is an artifact of the collection method. Thus it was not
          surprising that high doses of this non-Bt variety caused the same
          mortality to larvae as high doses of event Bt 11 transgenic corn.
          Furthermore, it was odd that there was 40% survival of larvae exposed
          to event Bt 11 pollen at doses of both 135 and 1300 grains
          cm<sup>&minus;2</sup>. These questions about the study, along with the
          fact that event 176, which has a higher concentration of Bt in the
          pollen, constitutes &lt;2% of the corn acreage planted in 2000, did
          not seem to enter the public discussion of this report. However, on

            In early 2001, the Environmental Defense Fund sent its fund-raising

            black and orange Monarch butterflies migrate thousands of miles from
            Mexico to Canada . . . but new scientific evidence suggests that the
            milkweed Monarch caterpillars are eating may kill them and unless we
            act now, there could be more unpleasant &rsquo;genetic
            surprises&rsquo; in the near future." Similarly, the
            January/February issue of the magazine of the Sierra Club, Sierra,
            has a postcard in it addressed to the CEO of Kraft Foods asking them
            to "move to GE-free production". On the other side of the card is a
            collage of Monarch butterflies with the words, "Genetically
            engineered food - even butterflies find it hard to swallow".</span

          publish reports that were incomplete and misleading. Further more, we

            worldwide, it has been estimated that nearly US$2.7 billion could be
            substituted with Bt biotechnology applications (<a

            plant's foliage is now a major insecticide.</span

          The EPA estimates that the use of Bt crops in the USA results in an
          annual reduction of &gt;7.7 million &lsquo;acre treatments&rsquo; of
          synthetic insecticides (<a

          In the case of the monarch butterfly, many entomologists believe the
          risks of Bt corn pollen are small compared to the destruction of their
          overwintering habitats (<a
            style="color: #000000"
            href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.1365-313X.2001.01118.x#b21"

            >Reuters, 2001</a
          >). But in the highly publicized and highly polarized discussions of
          Bt plants, the monarch has become a symbol and seems to have taken on
          a life of its own, a life much larger than the laboratory study which
          placed it squarely in the center of the controversy.
          <span style="background-color: #000000"

          concerns should be addressed in a rigorous scientific fashion
          unencumbered by sensationalism. We hope that scientists, the media,
          public policy-makers and the general public will regain their rightful
          roles in the dialogue about agricultural biotechnology, and be able to
          view the forthcoming data on field studies of monarchs and Bt corn in
          a more thoughtful and reserved manner than was observed with the
          previous two reports on monarch butterflies and Bt corn.</span
